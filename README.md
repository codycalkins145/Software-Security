# Software-Security


Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    
    The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a financial institution that deals with sensitive
    customer information.  The issue this client was looking to address was assistance in protecting 
    their data from external threats.
    
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

    When I found the client's software security vulnerabilities, I'd say I did very well with ensuring
    anything they used to run their program was updated to the most current secure version.  Secure
    coding is important so that potential attackers are not able to steal an sensitive data or perform
    other dangerous attacks.  Software security gives a company better financial and possibly legal 
    security so that they can continue to perform their business and protect their customers' data.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    The most challenging part of the vulnerability assesment was initially learning how to fix any
    dependency vulnerabilities.  It took a while to find out what the process was for fixing
    vulnerabilites reported from the dependency check, but once I did learn how to fix them it was
    easy to work through.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    I increased layers of security by using a secure algorithm cipher for encoding messages and
    ensuring any vulnerable dependencies were up to date.  In the future, I would continue to use
    OWASP Dependency Check for assessing vulnerabilities as it is thorough in describing vulnerable
    dependencies.  When it comes to mitigation techniques, I would likely use outsie sources to find
    others who may have had similar vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

    To ensure the code and application were functional and secure, I ran several functional tests
    Dependency Checks to check everything was functioning and as secure as intended.  To check for
    new vulnerabilities, I would run a Dependency Check every time the code was changed.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

    I think the tools or coding practices that might be helpful in the future are Maven, the 
    OWASP Dependency check, checksum verifications, and functional tests on code.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

    I may show future employers any refactored code and any documents that I submitted, such as the 
    Vulnerability Asessment Report or Practices for Secure Software Report.
